This Python code builds a Streamlit application that allows users to chat with information extracted from uploaded PDFs. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Imports:

streamlit as st: Imports the Streamlit library for creating web apps.
PyPDF2: Used for reading text from PDF files.
faiss: Library for creating efficient vector representations and searching.
langchain libraries: Provide tools for text processing, question answering, and chat models.
2. Helper Functions:

get_pdf_text(pdf_docs): Reads text from uploaded PDFs using PyPDF2.
get_text_chunks(text): Splits the extracted text into smaller chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
get_vector_store(text_chunks):
Creates vector representations of text chunks using OllamaEmbeddings.
Builds a FAISS vector store for efficient search based on these vectors.
Saves the vector store locally (optional for efficiency in future runs).
get_conversational_chain():
Defines a prompt template for question answering using the provided context (PDF text).
Creates a question answering chain using ChatOllama model.
user_input(user_question):
Creates vector representation for the user's question using OllamaEmbeddings.
Loads the saved vector store (faiss_index).
Finds similar documents (text chunks) to the user's question based on their vectors.
Runs the question answering chain with the user question and similar documents as input.
Prints the answer and displays it in Streamlit.
3. Main Function (main()):

Sets the page title and header for the Streamlit app.
Creates a text input field for users to enter their question.
If a question is entered:
Calls user_input to process the question and provide an answer based on the PDFs.
In the sidebar:
Creates a section for uploading PDF files (multiple allowed).
A submit button triggers processing:
Shows a spinner while processing the PDFs.
Extracts text from PDFs using get_pdf_text.
Splits text into chunks using get_text_chunks.
Creates and saves the vector store using get_vector_store.
Shows a success message upon completion.
4. Execution (if __name__ == "__main__":):

Runs the main function to start the Streamlit app.
Overall, this code demonstrates how to combine Streamlit, PDF text extraction, vector embeddings, and question answering models to create a user-friendly chatbot that interacts with information from uploaded PDFs.
